# python_pomodoro
A Pomodoro Timer Application using Python and Tkinter.

This project aims to develop my skills in: OOP, event-driven programming, UI/UX design, testing and validation, software deployment.

###  What is the Pomodoro technique?

Method of time management to help improve productivity:
- Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break.
- After 4 cycles, take a longer break (e.g., 15-30 minutes).

### What will the UI look like?
Development of this app will incorporate the following features.

- Simple, user-friendly GUI.
- Start/Stop/Pause/Reset buttons for timer.
- Customizable work/break intervals. Sliders to adjust values.
- Visual or sound alerts at the end of each session. Prompt to continue to next task or work/break session.
- Task checklist, tasks crossed out after completion.
